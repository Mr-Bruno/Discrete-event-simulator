Discrete event simulator of a queuing system of type G / G / k in which the management of the queue is performed according to the algorithm Selfish.The objective is to estimate the average response time of the system.

------------------------INSTRUCTIONS ----------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- The program will get all the input from the command line. The parameters of the command line must be the following:
  - Configuration file name with extension "cfg" by default.
  - Initial seed for random number generation.
  - Initial time to consider transient.

- Example: "xxxxxxxxx"
- The specific data to simulate will be read from the configuration file,  which will be of type ASCII and will have the following format:
  - In the first line will be stored separated by a space:
    1. The tolerance interval on the average.
    2.  Quality (probability) required.
  - The second line will contain, separated by a space, α and β for growing a user priority queue box and service box respectively.
  - The third line specifies management algorithm in the service box, which may be only FCFS or RR, indicated by a capital letter:
    - R for Round Robin.
    - F for First Called First Served.
  and the number of resources in the system (k), it will be an integer separated by a space from the previous parameter.
  - The fourth line will contain the distribution of the random variable inter-arrival time.
  - The fifth line will contain the distribution of the random variable time service requested.
