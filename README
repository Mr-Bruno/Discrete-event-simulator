- The program will get all the input from the command line. The parameters of the command line must be the following:
  á Configuration file name with extension "cfg" by default.
  á Initial seed for random number generation.
  á Initial time to consider transient.

- Example: "xxxxxxxxx"
- The specific data to simulate will be read from the configuration file,  which will be of type ASCII and will have the following format:
  á In the first line will be stored separated by a space:
    1. The tolerance interval on the average.
